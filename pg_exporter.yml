# 1. Configuration File
#
# The configuration file for pg_exporter is a YAML file.
# Default configuration are retrieved via following precedence:
#     1. command line args:      --config=<config path>
#     2. environment variables:  PG_EXPORTER_CONFIG=<config path>
#     3. pg_exporter.yml        (Current directory)
#     4. /etc/pg_exporter.yml   (etc config file)
#     5. /etc/pg_exporter       (etc config dir)

##
# 2. Config Format
#
# pg_exporter config could be a single YAML file, or a directory containing a series of separated YAML files.
# each YAML config file is consist of one or more metrics Collector definition. Which are top-level objects
# If a directory is provided, all YAML in that directory will be merged in alphabetic order.
# Collector definition examples are shown below.

##
# 3. Collector Example
#
#  # Here is an example of a metrics collector definition
#  pg_primary_only:       # Collector branch name. Must be UNIQUE among the entire configuration
#    name: pg             # Collector namespace, used as METRIC PREFIX, set to branch name by default, can be override
#                               the Same namespace may contain multiple collector branches. It`s the user`s responsibility
#                               to make sure that AT MOST ONE collector is picked for each namespace.

##
# 4. Collector Presets
#
# pg_exporter is shipped with a series of preset collectors (already numbered and ordered by filename)
#
# 1xx  Basic metrics:        basic info, metadata, settings
# 2xx  Replication metrics:  replication, walreceiver, downstream, sync standby, slots, subscription
# 3xx  Persist metrics:      size, wal, background writer, checkpoint, recovery, cache, shmem usage
# 4xx  Activity metrics:     backend count group by state, wait event, locks, xacts, queries
# 5xx  Progress metrics:     clustering, vacuuming, indexing, basebackup, copy
# 6xx  Database metrics:     pg_database, publication, subscription
# 7xx  Object metrics:       pg_class, table, index, function, sequence, default partition
# 8xx  Optional metrics:     optional metrics collector (disable by default, slow queries)
# 9xx  Pgbouncer metrics:    metrics from pgbouncer admin database `pgbouncer`
#
# 100-599 Metrics for entire database cluster  (scrape once)
# 600-899 Metrics for single database instance (scrape for each database ,except for pg_db itself)

##
# 5. Cache TTL
#
# Cache can be used for reducing query overhead, it can be enabled by setting a non-zero value for `ttl`
# It is highly recommended to use cache to avoid duplicate scrapes. Especially when you got multiple Prometheus
# scraping the same instance with slow monitoring queries. Setting `ttl` to zero or leaving blank will disable
# result caching, which is the default behavior
#
# TTL has to be smaller than your scrape interval. 15s scrape interval and 10s TTL is a good start for
# production environment. Some expensive monitoring queries (such as size/bloat check) will have longer `ttl`
# which can also be used as a mechanism to achieve `different scrape frequency`

##
# 6. Query Timeout
#
# Collectors can be configured with an optional Timeout. If the collector`s query executes more than that
# timeout, it will be canceled immediately. Setting the `timeout` to 0 or leaving blank will reset it to
# default timeout 0.1 (100ms). Setting it to any negative number will disable the query timeout feature.
# All queries have a default timeout of 100ms, if exceed, the query will be canceled immediately to avoid
# avalanche. You can explicitly overwrite that option. but beware: in some extreme cases, if all your
# timeout sum up greater your scrape/cache interval (usually 15s), the query may still be jammed.
# or, you can just disable potential slow queries.

##
# 7. Version Compatibility
#
# Each collector has two optional version compatibility parameters: `min_version` and `max_version`.
# These two parameters specify the version compatibility of the collector. If target postgres/pgbouncer
# version is less than `min_version`, or higher than `max_version`, the collector will not be installed.
# These two parameters are using PostgreSQL server version number format, which is a 6-digit integer
# format as <major:2 digit><minor:2 digit>:<release: 2 digit>.
# For example, 090600 stands for 9.6 and 120100 stands for 12.1
# And beware that version compatibility range is left-inclusive right exclusive: [min, max), set to zero or
# leaving blank will affect as -inf or +inf

##
# 8. Fatality
#
# If a collector is marked with `fatal` falls, the entire scrape operation will be marked as fail and key metrics
# `pg_up` / `pgbouncer_up` will be reset to 0. It is always a good practice to set up AT LEAST ONE fatal
# collector for pg_exporter. `pg.pg_primary_only` and `pgbouncer_list` are the default fatal collector.
#
# If a collector without `fatal` flag fails, it will increase global fail counters. But the scrape operation
# will carry on. The entire scrape result will not be marked as faile, thus will not affect the `<xx>_up` metric.

##
# 9. Skip
#
# Collector with `skip` flag set to true will NOT be installed.
# This could be a handy option to disable collectors
#
# 10. Tags and Planning
#
# Tags are designed for collector planning & schedule. It can be handy to customize which queries run
# on which instances. And thus you can use one-single monolith config for multiple environments
#
#  Tags are a list of strings, each string could be:
#  Pre-defined special tags
#    * `cluster` marks this collector as cluster level, so it will ONLY BE EXECUTED ONCE for the same PostgreSQL Server
#    * `primary` or `master` mark this collector as primary-only, so it WILL NOT work iff pg_is_in_recovery()
#    * `standby` or `replica` mark this collector as replica-only, so it WILL work iff pg_is_in_recovery()
#  Special tag prefix which have different interpretation:
#    * `dbname:<dbname>` means this collector will ONLY work on database with name `<dbname>`
#    * `username:<user>` means this collector will ONLY work when connect with user `<user>`
#    * `extension:<extname>` means this collector will ONLY work when extension `<extname>` is installed
#    * `schema:<nspname>` means this collector will only work when schema `<nspname>` exists
#  Customized positive tags (filter) and negative tags (taint)
#    * `not:<negtag>` means this collector WILL NOT work when exporter is tagged with `<negtag>`
#    * `<tag>` means this query WILL work if exporter is tagged with `<tag>` (special tags not included)
#
#  pg_exporter will trigger the Planning procedure after connecting to the target. It will gather database facts
#  and match them with tags and other metadata (such as supported version range). Collector will only
#  be installed if and only if it is compatible with the target server.
